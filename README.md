# Android Only 2011

Part of my presentation about building Custom UI Components at Android Only
2011.

## Demo 1

A price view using a `TextView`. Different colors applied within the `Activity`.

## Demo 2

A custom `PriceView` refactored from Demo 1.

## Demo 3

A compound component that consist of two views, one for the amount and one for
the currency.

## Demo 4

Demonstration of `<merge>`. Compare demo 3 and demo 4 in the Hiearchy Viewer
and see how `<merge` removed the extra layout.

## Demo 5

`PriceView` with custom attributes.

## Demo 6

A different theme is applied to the activity.

## Demo 7

Refactored `PriceView` to demonstrate how we can get rid of the two `TextView`s
for amount and currency.
